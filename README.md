<h2>Amazon_Vine_Analysis</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
The purpose of this project was to build a pipeline to analyze digital music purchase and review data using Google Colabs and a database hosted through AWS. Additionally, PostGRES SQL and pandas were used together with this.

<h3>Results</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In total, there were 4532 total non-Vine Amazon reviews for the digital music purchases dataset. There were no paid Vine reviews within this dataset</li>
    <li>A total of 2507 of these reviews received a five star rating.</li>
    <li>About ~55.3% of reviews received five stars.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Summary</h3>
There were no Vine reviews in this dataset. There were only non-Vine reviews. Thus, I am unable to state whether being sponsered through Vine causes a positivity bias. However, one thing to consider is other potential sources of payment (outside of Vine). It is possible that of some reviewers received payment received compensation outside of Vine.
